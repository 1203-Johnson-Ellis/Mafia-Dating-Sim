Silly little Ren'py game about some OCs.

EDITING HELP:
All game files are in -> "game" directory. All dialogue is in .rpy files whose names start with "script" -- "script.rpy" lays out the overall structure and jumps between other files as scene transitions occur.
All other .rpy files control technical aspects of setting up and running the game.
Don't worry about .rpyc files; those are purely for compiling and running, not for opening and editing.

Images are under -> "images" and audio is under -> "audio".

Ren'py documentation can be found at: https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/
But if you're only writing dialogue, you shouldn't need to touch that at all if you don't want to.

I edit, commit, and push through VSCode, but editing can also be done directly through GitHub if you have an account which I can add to the repository.
