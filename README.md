# Mafia-Dating-Sim
A silly little Ren'py game about some OCs.

### EDITING HELP:

All game files are in the `game` directory.

All dialogue is in .rpy files whose names start with `script`. `script.rpy` lays out the overall structure and jumps between other files as scene transitions occur.

All other .rpy files (whose names do NOT start with `script`) control technical aspects of setting up and running the game.
Don't worry about .rpyc files; those do not need to be opened. They are purely to compile the code.

Images are under the `images` directory and audio is under `audio`.

Ren'py documentation can be found [here](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/).
But if you're only writing dialogue, you shouldn't need to touch that at all if you don't want to.

If you have a GitHub account, I will add it to the repository. (GitHub isn't scary, I promise). You can edit directly through GitHub, but using an IDE like VSCode could prove helpful. Directions on how to link VSCode to Github can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github).

#### VSCode
If you do choose to use VSCode, to push your edits to GitHub you will need to go up to the taskbar and open a terminal. It will appear at the bottom of your screen. Then run the following three commands in the terminal one at a time (copy and paste the command, then hit enter):
```
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push
```
Your commit message can be anything, but its intention is to briefly describe the work you have done on the code.

You can then visit the GitHub page to make sure that your edits have gone through. You will need to refresh; it may take a few minutes to appear.

Shoot me a message for any troubleshooting or debugging issues.
