label day4:
    # Luci has been plotting all night, tries to take control of the group, talks to you and Val privately trying to win you over.
    # Felicien walks in and SEVERE headbutting with threats of violence that leads into shoving Domani around, knocking him over and he gets a bloody nose or something.
    # Felicien can’t do much more to him since he’s Catholic and covered in crosses.
    
    # Val escapes to wash out his clothes. Talk to them about where your loyalties lay. Val isn’t really sure either.
