label day3:
    # Giacomo Matteotti's assassination showing the prime minister's increasing vice grip. This does not bode well for the mafia.
    # Luci cutting ties with Catholicism due to the prime minister's actions, Domani more conflict over it more Catholic devotion. Visit a cathedral with Domani.
    # Elhoeva is Camorra blood in a 'Ndrangheta alliance (thus why in Calabria) and believes the others to be a warring Camorra faction
