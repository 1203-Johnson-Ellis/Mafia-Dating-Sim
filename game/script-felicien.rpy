    # Be good. Felicien is just getting us out of here so we don’t leave a blood trail leading directly to where we’re going.
    # You’ve been demoted, you don’t get your own business anymore, you have to watch oranges.
    # Felicien is seething.
    # You can put your head down and follow orders, argue with him about how this is dumb and going to get you killed, prod at the idea of something more.
